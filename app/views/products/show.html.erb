          <b><h5>Delivery and Setup</h5></b>
<hr>
At DENNY DOTS, We strive to provide the best home delivery service by partnering with reliable, professional delivery teams in your area. We’ll carefully select the best delivery options for your order to make sure everything arrives safe and sound. 
<b><h5>Furniture & Mattresses</h5></b>
<hr>
The delivery team will uncrate or unpack your new furniture/mattress, set it in place in the room of choice and remove all packaging/debris (with the exception of items marked "Customer Assembly Required"). Delivery teams are not able to remove or disassemble any existing furniture. If you need assistance building Assembly required items, please contact our Customer Care team who can help provide assembly services at competitive rates in many regions across India.
<b><h5>Scheduling Your Delivery</h5></b>
<hr>
During the checkout process, you can select a delivery date that works for you for most large item deliveries. This date is based on product and delivery date availability in your area.
When you complete your order, you will receive an email order confirmation, which will specify your preferred delivery date. We'll contact you if this date changes for any reason. We'll also send you an email within 7 days of your delivery to confirm the date and the name of the delivery provider.
Please contact our Customer Care team at least 48 hours before your selected delivery date if you would like to make any changes. 
<b><h5>Preparing for your Delivery</h5></b>
<hr>
The name on the order must match the government-issued photo ID of the person receiving the delivery. If you're having your product delivered somewhere else, or you'd like to have someone else receive it for you, we'll need to confirm those details with you prior to delivery. 
<br>
<br>
The delivery warehouse will contact you the day before or morning of delivery. To the volume of deliveries that must be routed each day, it is impossible to give exact times.
Please ensure your driveway and walkways are cleared to accept the delivery. As well please clear the path inside your home to the area where your purchase is to be placed.
<br>
<br>
Prior to ordering and delivery, pre-measure your doorways, entrances, hallways and staircases to ensure your new product will fit. A restocking fee will apply if unwrapped furniture, mattresses, appliances or electronics do not fit through the doorway or in the space intended.
<br>
<br>
Pin hinged doors can be removed to complete delivery. However, carpentry work such as removing doorway moldings, banisters, and so on cannot be done. All pictures in narrow hallways or stairs should be removed by you.  
<b><h5>During your Delivery</h5></b>
<hr>To help protect you from theft and fraud, we require the person listed on the order be on hand, show valid government-issued photo ID and provide their matching signature at the time of delivery.
<br>
<br>
 We request our customers to please inspect their order upon receipt for any visible signs of packaging damage, product damage, incorrect product or missing parts before signing the proof of delivery document and before assembling the product. 
 <br>
<br>
 If any damage is found, please specify these issues on the proof of delivery before signing for the order. Any damages or missing pieces on Assembly Required items must be reported within 48 hours of delivery by contacting our customer care team.

          <b><h5>Care Instruction </h5></b>
<hr>
TO PROTECT AND CARE FOR YOUR FURNITURE, DENNY DOTS SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING:
Avoid placing your furniture in direct sunlight, as sunlight causes fading.

<br>
<br>
Avoid extreme changes in temperature by arranging furniture away from radiators, heat and air vents and air conditioning units.

<br>
<br>

Avoid placing plastic or rubber materials (lamp bases, notebooks, placemats, etc.) on your furniture, as certain plastics contain ingredients that may damage the finish.

<br>
<br>

Periodically rotate accessories on furniture so they do not sit in the same spot all the time.

Use pads, cloth or felt to protect the furniture surface from plastic, rubber, hot dishes, beverages, bookends, flowerpots and vases.

<br>
<br>

Clean up spills immediately. Use a blotting rather than a wiping action. Water left over a long period of time will cause white spots in the finish. Alcohol, perfume, after-shave and medications can cause severe finish damage.

<br>
<br>
Use a protective pad when writing with a ballpoint pen on the furniture surface.

Lift and place objects rather than dragging them across the furniture surface.

Avoid placing furniture directly under windows.
